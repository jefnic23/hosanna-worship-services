<div class="body"><span> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>7</sup></span></span><span>O&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span>, you have enticed me,</span><br><span>
                    and I was enticed;</span><br><span>
                   you have overpowered me,</span><br><span>
                    and you have prevailed.</span><br><span>
                   I have become a laughingstock all day long;</span><br><span>
                    everyone mocks me.</span><br><span> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>8</sup></span></span><span>For whenever I speak, I must cry out,</span><br><span>
                    I must shout, “Violence and destruction!”</span><br><span>
                   For the word of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> has become for me</span><br><span>
                    a reproach and derision all day long.</span><br><span> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>9</sup></span></span><span>If I say, “I will not mention him,</span><br><span>
                    or speak any more in his name,”</span><br><span>
                   then within me there is something like a burning fire</span><br><span>
                    shut up in my bones;</span><br><span>
                   I am weary with holding it in,</span><br><span>
                    and I cannot.</span><br><span> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>10</sup></span></span><span>For I hear many whispering:</span><br><span>
                    “Terror is all around!</span><br><span>
                   Denounce him! Let us denounce him!”</span><br><span>
                    All my close friends</span><br><span>
                    are watching for me to stumble.</span><br><span>
                   “Perhaps he can be enticed,</span><br><span>
                    and we can prevail against him,</span><br><span>
                    and take our revenge on him.”</span><br><span> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>11</sup></span></span><span>But the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> is with me like a dread warrior;</span><br><span>
                    therefore my persecutors will stumble,</span><br><span>
                    and they will not prevail.</span><br><span>
                   They will be greatly shamed,</span><br><span>
                    for they will not succeed.</span><br><span>
                   Their eternal dishonor</span><br><span>
                    will never be forgotten.</span><br><span> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>12</sup></span></span><span>O&nbsp;<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> of hosts, you test the righteous,</span><br><span>
                    you see the heart and the mind;</span><br><span>
                   let me see your retribution upon them,</span><br><span>
                    for to you I have committed my cause.</span><br><br><span> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>13</sup></span></span><span>Sing to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span>;</span><br><span>
                    praise the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span>!</span><br><span>
                   For he has delivered the life of the needy</span><br><span>
                    from the hands of evildoers.</span><br></div>
