                                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                                    <div>All Saints celebrates the baptized people of God, living and dead, who are the
                                          body of Christ. As November heralds the dying of the landscape in many
                                          northern regions, the readings and liturgy call us to remember all who have
                                          died in Christ and whose baptism is complete. At the Lord’s table we gather
                                          with the faithful of every time and place, trusting that the promises of God
                                          will be fulfilled and that all tears will be wiped away in the new Jerusalem.

                                          <p>All Saints Sunday and the appointed readings are pregnant with themes of
                                                stark contrast: death and life, condemnation and redemption, sorrow and
                                                joy, suffering and relief, present life and future life. Such is life,
                                                too, as baptized children of God. The very nature of our lives is of
                                                stark contrast.</p>
                                          <p>By virtue of our baptism into the death and resurrection of Jesus, we are
                                                made saints while we are still sinners. Every day in this nautically
                                                juxtaposed life we navigate through rough waters such as sin, evil,
                                                pain, heartache, addiction, abuse, hunger, disease, and war. But our
                                                bearing is always set, not by the North Star but by the Daystar, who has
                                                been the heading for the faithful of every generation. With the
                                                scriptures as our compass and the confessions our map, we sail as a part
                                                of the great flotilla of saints on the waters of baptism, with the wind
                                                of the Spirit at our backs, always pointed in the direction of our
                                                guiding Daystar.</p>
                                          <p>Today we give thanks for the saints who have gone before us, for the saints
                                                still among us, and for the saints of God still to come. We give thanks
                                                for the examples of faithful living that the saints have given us as
                                                they navigated the stormy waters of life, and also for the faithful acts
                                                of service we are empowered by God’s Holy Spirit to do in our own seas.
                                                We give thanks, too, for the fullness of eternal life in which the

                                                how a community or even an entire culture interacts with death is
                                                through the sacred tradition of commemorating the saints. In Slovakia,
                                                All Saints Day is a national holiday as well as a religious one. Slovak
                                                cemeteries come alive as people adorn their loved ones’ tombs with
                                                candles, flowers, and other local trinkets. It is typical to see ancient
                                                water basins throughout the graveyard, available for visitors to wash
                                                tombstones. All Saints Day is also a family affair where all generations
                                                learn about their heritage while facing their own mortality.</p>

                                          <p>It is common for people to ignore the realities of death out of fear. What
                                                are some ways clergy can engage in this difficult topic? Perhaps host a
                                                discussion on funeral planning and explore what it means to “believe in
                                                the resurrection of the body and the life everlasting.” Reach out to
                                                local funeral directors to see if they would present a forum to your
                                                congregation on preparing for death. Martin Luther believed it was
                                                necessary for every Christian to prepare for their death in order to put
                                                families at ease and quell any internal disputes regarding estates and
                                                money.</p>

                                          <p>All Saints Day is when the universal church—past, present, and
                                                future—gathers to rejoice in the one body of Christ. Think of all the
                                                people that entails! John describes this in Revelation as “a great
                                                multitude that no one could count, from every nation, from all tribes
                                                and peoples and languages, standing before the throne” (Rev. 7:9). How
                                                do we help others recognize their sainthood as well as their part in the
                                                salvation story? There are famous and not-so-famous saints, but it is
                                                important to emphasize that sainthood through baptism is the great
                                                equalizer, for as 1 John says: “See what love the Father has given us,
                                                that we should be called children of God; and that is what we are”
                                                (3:1). This day could inspire a message that in holy communion we are in
                                                the presence of Christ and of all the saints of every time and place.

                                          <p>Talking about death at any age is hard, but how does one talk about it with
                                                a child? Christians live with “daily dying”; at funerals we are ideally
                                                focused more on baptism than on all the person’s life achievements.
                                                Christians gather around a man dying on a cross, proclaiming his
                                                crucifixion as gospel (1 Corinthians 2:1-2). A big part of the Christian
                                                message is death. Consider hosting a mini-retreat for young people who
                                                have experienced grief in some fashion (moving, divorce, or family
                                                death). In his book <em>Remembering Crystal</em>, Sebastian Loth gently
                                                explains to children the grief process (New York: North-South Books,
                                                2010).</p>
                                          <div class="resourceSubsection">Song</div>
                                          <p>One of the suggested hymns for today is “In our day of thanksgiving” (ELW
                                                429). This is an excellent hymn to include in the All Saints Day or
                                                Sunday’s service. Can the day to commemorate the dead be called a day of
                                                thanksgiving? Yes, when we examine its message: “. . . one psalm let us
                                                offer for the saints who before us received the reward; when the shadow
                                                of death fell upon them, we sorrowed, but now we rejoice that they rest
                                                in the Lord.” Perhaps useful for a eucharistic connection, highlight:
                                                “In the morning of life, and at noon, and at evening, they were gathered
                                                to heaven from our worship below; but not till God’s love, at the font
                                                and the altar, had clothed them with grace for the way they should go.”

                                                      Community</em> (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress, 2013), former
                                                bishop Stephen Bouman uses table imagery to explore ways the church can

                                                He opens with a salient theme. A Korean family buries their family’s

                                          <p>On All Saints Sunday we remember the great cloud of witnesses who have gone
                                                before us on the journey through life. Children may find this day
                                                fascinating as we remember loved ones with lit candles, special prayers,
                                                and liturgies. Children themselves may have experienced the loss of a
                                                family member, or perhaps a pet, and may want to remember them. Today’s
                                                reading from Revelation pictures the multitude who have gone before us
                                                singing praise to God. Children can join their voices to these songs
                                                (“Holy, holy, holy” or “This is the feast”) to remember and reunite with

                                                those who have died and returned to the earth. Theologian Dorothee
                                                Soelle wonders if the equality we experience in death inspires
                                                revolutionary movements for equality among the living. She writes in
                                                <em>The Mystery of Death</em>: “I often ask myself whether death is not
                                                the very inventor of equality and whether human beings are permitted any
                                                equality at all without the consciousness of death’s power. As [death]
                                                is repressed in the world of the rich, so too the consciousness of human
                                                equality disappears. . . . Can equality in the negative sense be so
                                                neatly distinguished from equality in the positive, revolutionary sense
                                                of human rights for all?” (Fortress Press, 1984, p. 10). Could it be
                                                that the communion of saints and the earth itself work together to
                                                inspire revolutionary movements for equality and justice?</p>

                                          <div>It seems that in the mid-80s the author of the gospel of Matthew compiled
                                                smaller units of the sayings of Jesus into what we call the Sermon on
                                                the Mount, a single lengthy address meant to parallel the primary
                                                address of Moses from Mount Sinai. The word translated “blessed” can
                                                also be translated “happy.” The Beatitudes indicate Matthew’s sense of
                                                the transformed values inherent within the kingdom of heaven. This
                                                kingdom, of central importance in this gospel, is not here defined, but

                                          <div>Probably written in the late first century or early second century,
                                                Revelation names John as its author, who never claims to be the John of
                                                the original Jesus movement. The author employs the apocalyptic style
                                                and imagery of Daniel and intertestamental writings in his visions of
                                                the evil power of the Roman Empire and the salvation that Jesus Christ
                                                will bring at the end of all things. Typical of those social situations
                                                that inspire apocalyptic thinking, Revelation sees no way out of the
                                                current sufferings except for divine intervention and the consequent
                                                destruction of evil. The excerpt describes a vision of heaven in which
                                                the saved represent all peoples on earth who have suffered for their
                                                faith but now experience happiness.</div>

                                          <div>Anonymously written in the late first or early second century perhaps in
                                                Ephesus, 1 John evidences a community familiar with the theological
                                                style of the Gospel of John. Not actually a letter, the essay declares
                                                the truth of the community’s faith in the sacrificial death of Jesus
                                                Christ, warns the community about false teachings, and calls the
                                                community to mutual love. The excerpt states that the children of God,
                                                those who know and are known by God, are not those known by the world.

                                          <div><strong>All Saints</strong></div>
                                          <div>The custom of commemorating the saints of the church, especially martyrs,
                                                on a single day originated in the fourth century. By the eighth century,
                                                the festival commemorating all saints had been moved in England and
                                                Ireland to November 1 in order to Christianize the Celtic harvest
                                                festival of Samhain which marked the beginning of winter and communal
                                                attention to the dead. In current Christian use, the day is dedicated to
                                                thanksgiving for all the unnamed who died in the Lord. In many
                                                assemblies, the names of the local dead are read aloud, a focus
                                                originally associated with All Souls Day on November 2. The conflation
                                                of the two emphases fits with the Protestant belief that the all the
                                                Christian dead are saints and none needs release from purgatory.</div>
                                          </p>
                                          <p>The readings for All Saints are best used at a service scheduled on
                                                November 1. Some assemblies observe All Saints on the first Sunday in
                                                November. Current usage suggests instead to maintain the usual Sunday
                                                readings but to add an emphasis on all saints, for example by praying
                                                both prayers of the day (Lectionary 31 and All Saints) and by reading
                                                out the names of the past year’s local dead in a solemn litany of
                                                thanksgiving.</p>

                                          <div>The Beatitudes are appointed for All Saints because they describe a
                                                surprising grouping of persons who find their wholeness in blessings
                                                from God, rather than in the values of this world. True happiness comes
                                                from life with God. The Beatitudes proclaim trust that God will bring
                                                about salvation, despite appearances. In true biblical fashion, God is
                                                on the side of the underdog.</div>

                                          <div>This magnificent poetic passage describes the worship of God (“the
                                                throne”) and Christ (“the Lamb”) in the heavenly realm. Joining with
                                                angels, church leaders, and the “four living creatures” are all
                                                believers (“robed in white”) who suffered on earth. The vision means to
                                                comfort Christians who mourn their dead and to inspire trust that God
                                                will bring joy out of sorrow.</div>

                                          <div>The reading expresses our trust that at the end, we will see God, who
                                                loves us. As children, we will see the Father; unknown by the world, we
                                                are known by God.</div>

                                          <p class="sectionHead">Images in the Readings</p>
                                          <p>The main image in the gospel reading is <strong>the kingdom of
                                                      heaven</strong>. The image of kingdom stresses a communal and
                                                social reality, not an individual psychic experience. This image has
                                                been so narrowed by especially nineteenth-century artists into a kind of
                                                summer camp in the skies that it is not easy to see in the image God’s
                                                transforming rule of righteousness. In Revelation, the kingdom is
                                                imagined with all the angels and saints gathered around God’s throne, a
                                                depiction common in medieval art but itself distant from our
                                                understanding of the universe.</p>
                                          <p>The reading from Revelation resembles a concordance of biblical imagery,
                                                each of which connects with numerous biblical passages: <strong>every
                                                      nation</strong>, <strong>throne</strong>, <strong>Lamb</strong>,
                                                <strong>palm branches</strong>, <strong>angels</strong>, <strong>the
                                                      four living creatures</strong>, <strong>washed</strong>,
                                                <strong>blood</strong>, <strong>hunger</strong>,
                                                <strong>thirst</strong>, <strong>the sun’s heat</strong>,
                                                <strong>shepherd</strong>, <strong>springs of the water of
                                                      life</strong>. That the saints are <strong>robed in white</strong>
                                                suggests early Christian baptismal garb, and the word “alb” refers to
                                                these white robes that clothe the baptized. In true metaphoric fashion,
                                                in which words assert the opposite of a literal meaning, the robes are
                                                made white by being washed in blood.</p>

                                                asks for continued blessings. The prayer does not invoke the assistance
                                                of saints, but rather petitions for the grace to follow their lives of

                                                414). We join our praise with that of angel choirs, the apostles, the

                                                Triune God. This hymn derives from an anonymous metrical version of the
                                                classic <em>Te Deum</em>, perhaps originally crafted by Bishop Niceta in

                                                creatures as good, the visions of heaven in the Book of Revelation
                                                describe not disembodied spirits floating around the skies, but
                                                resurrected human bodies who fall “on their faces” and who drink from
                                                “springs of the water of life.” This good earth is the gift God has
                                                granted to us here and now, and blessed are those who have come to honor
                                                God’s creation.</p>

                                          <p>Explain to children the meanings of the word “saint.” It can mean biblical
                                                characters, like St. Paul; it can refer to famous Christians over the
                                                centuries, like St. Patrick; and it also can mean every baptized person,
                                                those who have already died, and those still alive. Have each child say
                                                out loud, “I’m a saint, and so are you.”</p>

                                                Christ is surrounded by angels and saints whose varied attire indicates

                                          <div>Then John saw the river, and the multitude was there. And a sweetness
                                                filled John as he heard the sound of singing: the singing was for him. .
                                                . . No power could hold this army back, no water disperse them, no fire
                                                consume them. They wandered in the valley forever; and they smote the
                                                rock, forever; and the waters sprang, perpetually, in the perpetual
                                                desert. They cried unto the Lord forever, they were cast down forever,
                                                and lifted up their eyes forever. No, the fire could not hurt them, and
                                                yes, the lions’ jaws were stopped; the serpent was not their master, the
                                                grave was not their resting-place, the earth was not their home. Job
                                                bore them witness, and Abraham was their father, Moses had elected to
                                                suffer with them rather than glory in sin for a season. Shadrach,
                                                Meshach, and Abednego had gone before them into the fire, their grief
                                                had been sung by David, and Jeremiah had wept for them. Ezekiel had
                                                prophesied upon them, these scattered bones, these slain, and, in the
                                                fullness to time, the prophet, John, had come out of the wilderness,
                                                crying that the promise was for them. They were encompassed with a very
                                                cloud of witnesses: Judas, who had betrayed the Lord; Thomas, who had
                                                doubted Him; Peter, who had trembled at the crowing of a cock; Stephen,
                                                who had been stoned; Paul, who had been bound; the blind man crying in
                                                the dusty road, the dead man rising from the grave. And they looked unto
                                                Jesus, the author and the finisher of their faith, running with patience
                                                the race He had set before them; they endured the cross, and they
                                                despised the shame, and waited to join Him, one day, in glory, at the
