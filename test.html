<div class="body"><span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>35</sup></span>Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing every disease and every sickness. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>36</sup></span>When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>37</sup></span>Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>38</sup></span>therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.”<br> <sup>10:</sup><span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>1</sup></span>Then Jesus summoned his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to cure every disease and every sickness. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>2</sup></span>These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon, also known as Peter, and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John; <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>3</sup></span>Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>4</sup></span>Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot, the one who betrayed him.<br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>5</sup></span>These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: “Go nowhere among the Gentiles, and enter no town of the Samaritans, <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>6</sup></span>but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>7</sup></span>As you go, proclaim the good news, ‘The kingdom of heaven has come near.’ <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>8</sup></span>Cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. You received without payment; give without payment.
    [<span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>9</sup></span>Take no gold, or silver, or copper in your belts, <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>10</sup></span>no bag for your journey, or two tunics, or sandals, or a staff; for laborers deserve their food. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>11</sup></span>Whatever town or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy, and stay there until you leave. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>12</sup></span>As you enter the house, greet it. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>13</sup></span>If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>14</sup></span>If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that house or town. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>15</sup></span>Truly I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.<br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>16</sup></span>“See, I am sending you out like sheep into the midst of wolves; so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>17</sup></span>Beware of them, for they will hand you over to councils and flog you in their synagogues; <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>18</sup></span>and you will be dragged before governors and kings because of me, as a testimony to them and the Gentiles. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>19</sup></span>When they hand you over, do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say; for what you are to say will be given to you at that time; <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>20</sup></span>for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>21</sup></span>Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death; <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>22</sup></span>and you will be hated by all because of my name. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>23</sup></span>When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next; for truly I tell you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.”]
