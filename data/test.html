<div class="body"><span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>9</sup></span>As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth; and he said to him, “Follow me.” And he got up and followed him.<br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>10</sup></span>And as he sat at dinner in the house, many tax collectors and sinners came and were sitting with him and his disciples. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>11</sup></span>When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>12</sup></span>But when he heard this, he said, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>13</sup></span>Go and learn what this means, ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ For I have come to call not the righteous but sinners.”<br><br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>18</sup></span>While he was saying these things to them, suddenly a leader of the synagogue came in and knelt before him, saying, “My daughter has just died; but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>19</sup></span>And Jesus got up and followed him, with his disciples. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>20</sup></span>Then suddenly a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his cloak, <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>21</sup></span>for she said to herself, “If I only touch his cloak, I will be made well.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>22</sup></span>Jesus turned, and seeing her he said, “Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well.” And instantly the woman was made well. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>23</sup></span>When Jesus came to the leader’s house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion, <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>24</sup></span>he said, “Go away; for the girl is not dead but sleeping.” And they laughed at him. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>25</sup></span>But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl got up. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>26</sup></span>And the report of this spread throughout that district.</div>
