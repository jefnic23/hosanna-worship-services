Psalm 130
1 Out of the depths I cry to you, O Lord;
2 O Lord, hear my voice! Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication.
3 If you were to keep watch over sins, O Lord, who could stand?
4 Yet with you is forgiveness, in order that you may be feared. 
5 I wait for you, O Lord; my soul waits; in your word is my hope.
6 My soul waits for the Lord more than those who keep watch for the morning, more than those who keep watch for the morning.
7 O Israel, wait for the Lord, for with the Lord there is steadfast love; with the Lord there is plenteous redemption.
8 For the Lord shall redeem Israel from all their sins.
