            <h2> Sunday, April 2, 2023<br />Sunday of the Passion / Palm Sunday, Year A</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <div>Today, we encounter the paradox that defines our faith: Jesus Christ is glorified king and humiliated servant. We too are full of paradox: like Peter, we fervently desire to follow Christ, but find ourselves afraid, denying God. We wave palms in celebration today as Christ comes into our midst, and we follow with trepidation as his path leads to death on the cross. Amid it all we are invited into this paradoxical promise of life through Christ’s broken body and outpoured love in a meal of bread and wine. We begin this week that stands at the center of the church year, anticipating the completion of God’s astounding work.</div>
    <h3>Confession and Forgiveness</h3>
    <div><p>
  <div class="rubric">
    <div>All may make the sign of the cross, the sign that is marked at baptism, as the presiding minister begins.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="body">
    <div>Blessed be the holy Trinity, <span class="redtext">☩</span> one God,</div>
    <div>who journeys with us these forty days,</div>
    <div>and sustains us with the gift of grace.</div>
    <div><strong>Amen.</strong></div>
  </div>
</p>
<div class="body">
  <p>
    <div>Let us acknowledge before God and one another</div>
    <div>our need for repentance and God’s mercy.</div>

<div class="rubric">
  <p>Silence is kept for reflection.</p>
</div>
<div class="body">
  <p>
    <div>Holy God,</div>
    <div><strong>we confess to you our faults and failings.</strong></div>
    <div><strong>Too often we neglect and do not trust your holy word;</strong></div>
    <div><strong>we take for ourselves instead of giving to others;</strong></div>
    <div><strong>we spoil rather than steward your creation;</strong></div>
    <div><strong>we cause hurt though you call us to heal;</strong></div>
    <div><strong>we choose fear over compassion.</strong></div>
    <div><strong>Forgive us, renew us, and lead us,</strong></div>
    <div><strong>as we seek to follow in your way of life.</strong></div>
    <div><strong>Amen.</strong></div>
  </p>
  <p>
    <div>Hear the good news:</div>
    <div>God so loved the world that God gave the only Son,</div>
    <div>so that all may receive life.</div>
    <div>This promise is for you!</div>
    <div>God embraces you with divine mercy,</div>
    <div><span class="redtext">☩</span> forgives you in Christ’s name,</div>
    <div>and revives you in the Spirit’s power.</div>
    <div><strong>Amen.</strong></div>

</div></div>
    <h3>Prayer of the Day</h3>
    <div><div class="body">
  <p>
    <div>Everlasting God, in your endless love for the human race you sent our Lord Jesus Christ to take on our nature and to suffer death on the cross. In your mercy enable us to share in his obedience to your will and in the glorious victory of his resurrection, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.</div>
    <div><strong>Amen.</strong></div>
  </p>
</div></div>
    <h3>Prayer of the Day (Alternate)</h3>
    <div><div class="body">
  <p>
    <div>Sovereign God, you have established your rule in the human heart through the servanthood of Jesus Christ. By your Spirit, keep us in the joyful procession of those who with their tongues confess Jesus as Lord and with their lives praise him as Savior, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.</div>
    <div><strong>Amen.</strong></div>
  </p>
</div></div>
    <h3>Prayer of the Day (2nd Alternate)</h3>
    <div><div class="body">
  <p>
    <div>O God of mercy and might, in the mystery of the passion of your Son you offer your infinite life to the world. Gather us around the cross of Christ, and preserve us until the resurrection, through Jesus Christ, our Savior and Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.</div>
    <div><strong>Amen.</strong></div>
  </p>
</div></div>
    <h3>Gospel Acclamation</h3>

    <div><div class="body"><span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>5</sup></span>Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus,<br><span> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>6</sup></span></span><span>who, though he was in the form of God,</span><br><span>

    <div><div class="body"><span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>14</sup></span>One of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>15</sup></span>and said, “What will you give me if I betray him to you?” They paid him thirty pieces of silver. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>16</sup></span>And from that moment he began to look for an opportunity to betray him.<br><br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>17</sup></span>On the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Where do you want us to make the preparations for you to eat the Passover?” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>18</sup></span>He said, “Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, ‘The Teacher says, My time is near; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.’ ” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>19</sup></span>So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover meal.<br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>20</sup></span>When it was evening, he took his place with the twelve; <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>21</sup></span>and while they were eating, he said, “Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>22</sup></span>And they became greatly distressed and began to say to him one after another, “Surely not I, Lord?” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>23</sup></span>He answered, “The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>24</sup></span>The Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that one by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that one not to have been born.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>25</sup></span>Judas, who betrayed him, said, “Surely not I, Rabbi?” He replied, “You have said so.”<br><br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>26</sup></span>While they were eating, Jesus took a loaf of bread, and after blessing it he broke it, gave it to the disciples, and said, “Take, eat; this is my body.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>27</sup></span>Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks he gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you; <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>28</sup></span>for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>29</sup></span>I tell you, I will never again drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.”<br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>30</sup></span>When they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.<br><br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>31</sup></span>Then Jesus said to them, “You will all become deserters because of me this night; for it is written,
				<br><span>
                   ‘I will strike the shepherd,</span><br><span>
                    and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’</span><br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>32</sup></span>But after I am raised up, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>33</sup></span>Peter said to him, “Though all become deserters because of you, I will never desert you.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>34</sup></span>Jesus said to him, “Truly I tell you, this very night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>35</sup></span>Peter said to him, “Even though I must die with you, I will not deny you.” And so said all the disciples.<br><br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>36</sup></span>Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>37</sup></span>He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be grieved and agitated. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>38</sup></span>Then he said to them, “I am deeply grieved, even to death; remain here, and stay awake with me.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>39</sup></span>And going a little farther, he threw himself on the ground and prayed, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not what I want but what you want.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>40</sup></span>Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter, “So, could you not stay awake with me one hour? <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>41</sup></span>Stay awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>42</sup></span>Again he went away for the second time and prayed, “My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>43</sup></span>Again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>44</sup></span>So leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>45</sup></span>Then he came to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? See, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>46</sup></span>Get up, let us be going. See, my betrayer is at hand.”<br><br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>47</sup></span>While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived; with him was a large crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>48</sup></span>Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “The one I will kiss is the man; arrest him.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>49</sup></span>At once he came up to Jesus and said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed him. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>50</sup></span>Jesus said to him, “Friend, do what you are here to do.” Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and arrested him. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>51</sup></span>Suddenly, one of those with Jesus put his hand on his sword, drew it, and struck the slave of the high priest, cutting off his ear. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>52</sup></span>Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>53</sup></span>Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels? <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>54</sup></span>But how then would the scriptures be fulfilled, which say it must happen in this way?” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>55</sup></span>At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, “Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as though I were a bandit? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>56</sup></span>But all this has taken place, so that the scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.<br><br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>57</sup></span>Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest, in whose house the scribes and the elders had gathered. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>58</sup></span>But Peter was following him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest; and going inside, he sat with the guards in order to see how this would end. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>59</sup></span>Now the chief priests and the whole council were looking for false testimony against Jesus so that they might put him to death, <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>60</sup></span>but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>61</sup></span>and said, “This fellow said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days.’ ” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>62</sup></span>The high priest stood up and said, “Have you no answer? What is it that they testify against you?” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>63</sup></span>But Jesus was silent. Then the high priest said to him, “I put you under oath before the living God, tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>64</sup></span>Jesus said to him, “You have said so. But I tell you,
				<br><span>
                   From now on you will see the Son of Man</span><br><span>
                    seated at the right hand of Power</span><br><span>
                    and coming on the clouds of heaven.”</span><br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>65</sup></span>Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “He has blasphemed! Why do we still need witnesses? You have now heard his blasphemy. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>66</sup></span>What is your verdict?” They answered, “He deserves death.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>67</sup></span>Then they spat in his face and struck him; and some slapped him, <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>68</sup></span>saying, “Prophesy to us, you Messiah! Who is it that struck you?”<br><br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>69</sup></span>Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. A servant-girl came to him and said, “You also were with Jesus the Galilean.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>70</sup></span>But he denied it before all of them, saying, “I do not know what you are talking about.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>71</sup></span>When he went out to the porch, another servant-girl saw him, and she said to the bystanders, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>72</sup></span>Again he denied it with an oath, “I do not know the man.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>73</sup></span>After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, “Certainly you are also one of them, for your accent betrays you.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>74</sup></span>Then he began to curse, and he swore an oath, “I do not know the man!” At that moment the cock crowed. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>75</sup></span>Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said: “Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.” And he went out and wept bitterly.<sup>27:</sup><br><br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>1</sup></span>When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people conferred together against Jesus in order to bring about his death. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>2</sup></span>They bound him, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate the governor.<br><br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>3</sup></span>When Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>4</sup></span>He said, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.” But they said, “What is that to us? See to it yourself.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>5</sup></span>Throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed; and he went and hanged himself. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>6</sup></span>But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, “It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since they are blood money.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>7</sup></span>After conferring together, they used them to buy the potter’s field as a place to bury foreigners. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>8</sup></span>For this reason that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>9</sup></span>Then was fulfilled what had been spoken through the prophet Jeremiah, “And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of the one on whom a price had been set, on whom some of the people of Israel had set a price, <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>10</sup></span>and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.”<br><br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>11</sup></span>Now Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus said, “You say so.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>12</sup></span>But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he did not answer. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>13</sup></span>Then Pilate said to him, “Do you not hear how many accusations they make against you?” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>14</sup></span>But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed.<br><br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>15</sup></span>Now at the festival the governor was accustomed to release a prisoner for the crowd, anyone whom they wanted. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>16</sup></span>At that time they had a notorious prisoner, called Jesus Barabbas. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>17</sup></span>So after they had gathered, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release for you, Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Messiah?” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>18</sup></span>For he realized that it was out of jealousy that they had handed him over. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>19</sup></span>While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, “Have nothing to do with that innocent man, for today I have suffered a great deal because of a dream about him.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>20</sup></span>Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus killed. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>21</sup></span>The governor again said to them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” And they said, “Barabbas.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>22</sup></span>Pilate said to them, “Then what should I do with Jesus who is called the Messiah?” All of them said, “Let him be crucified!” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>23</sup></span>Then he asked, “Why, what evil has he done?” But they shouted all the more, “Let him be crucified!”<br><br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>24</sup></span>So when Pilate saw that he could do nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took some water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of this man’s blood; see to it yourselves.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>25</sup></span>Then the people as a whole answered, “His blood be on us and on our children!” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>26</sup></span>So he released Barabbas for them; and after flogging Jesus, he handed him over to be crucified.<br><br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>27</sup></span>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor’s headquarters, and they gathered the whole cohort around him. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>28</sup></span>They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>29</sup></span>and after twisting some thorns into a crown, they put it on his head. They put a reed in his right hand and knelt before him and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>30</sup></span>They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>31</sup></span>After mocking him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.<br><br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>32</sup></span>As they went out, they came upon a man from Cyrene named Simon; they compelled this man to carry his cross. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>33</sup></span>And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull), <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>34</sup></span>they offered him wine to drink, mixed with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not drink it. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>35</sup></span>And when they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among themselves by casting lots; <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>36</sup></span>then they sat down there and kept watch over him. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>37</sup></span>Over his head they put the charge against him, which read, “This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.”<br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>38</sup></span>Then two bandits were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>39</sup></span>Those who passed by derided him, shaking their heads <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>40</sup></span>and saying, “You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>41</sup></span>In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes and elders, were mocking him, saying, <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>42</sup></span>“He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>43</sup></span>He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he wants to; for he said, ‘I am God’s Son.’ ” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>44</sup></span>The bandits who were crucified with him also taunted him in the same way.<br><br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>45</sup></span>From noon on, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>46</sup></span>And about three o’clock Jesus cried with a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” that is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>47</sup></span>When some of the bystanders heard it, they said, “This man is calling for Elijah.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>48</sup></span>At once one of them ran and got a sponge, filled it with sour wine, put it on a stick, and gave it to him to drink. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>49</sup></span>But the others said, “Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>50</sup></span>Then Jesus cried again with a loud voice and breathed his last. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>51</sup></span>At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks were split. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>52</sup></span>The tombs also were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>53</sup></span>After his resurrection they came out of the tombs and entered the holy city and appeared to many. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>54</sup></span>Now when the centurion and those with him, who were keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were terrified and said, “Truly this man was God’s Son!”<br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>55</sup></span>Many women were also there, looking on from a distance; they had followed Jesus from Galilee and had provided for him. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>56</sup></span>Among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.<br><br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>57</sup></span>When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>58</sup></span>He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus; then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>59</sup></span>So Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>60</sup></span>and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock. He then rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb and went away. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>61</sup></span>Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.<br><br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>62</sup></span>The next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>63</sup></span>and said, “Sir, we remember what that impostor said while he was still alive, ‘After three days I will rise again.’ <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>64</sup></span>Therefore command the tomb to be made secure until the third day; otherwise his disciples may go and steal him away, and tell the people, ‘He has been raised from the dead,’ and the last deception would be worse than the first.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>65</sup></span>Pilate said to them, “You have a guard of soldiers; go, make it as secure as you can.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>66</sup></span>So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone.</div></div>

            <h2> Sunday, April 2, 2023<br />Sunday of the Passion / Palm Sunday</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <div><div class="resourceSubsection">True Humility</div>
<p>The servanthood of a teacher in Isaiah, the outcast in the psalm, those who bow down in Philippians: today’s readings teach humility. On this day we move from Christ’s triumphant ride on a humble donkey to the humiliation of the cross. The humility of the characters in the passion story is in question: Judas, Pilate, the Twelve, chief priests and elders, Barabbas, the crowd, the soldiers, two bandits. Among other things, their lack of humility is what brings about the passion of Christ. There is only one truly humble person in this story: Jesus the Christ. Matthew’s humble Jesus cries out from the cross to ask God why he has been forsaken.</p>
<p>Only in the stories of the resurrection do other humble characters appear: the centurion, the women, Joseph of Arimathea. A careful look at the complexity of humility in the palm and passion stories could set up a reflective theme carried through to Easter. Who in each story do we regard as humble? Why? How does our humility compare? Are there characters who seem to gain or lose humility in the course of the story from the triumphant entry to the resurrection? A deep and meaningful understanding of humility is a worthy and lasting gift to take away from the season of Lent and the celebration of Easter.</p>
<p>Joseph of Arimathea is a particularly good character on which to base an understanding of humility. A close look at all references to him in the Gospels, and a bit of creative narrative, create an image of a truly humble believer. He is referenced in both canonical and apocryphal texts. His devotion represents deep humility that leads to the very finest of good works as he cares for the body of Jesus.</p></div>
    <h3>Ideas</h3>
    <div><div class="resourceSubsection">Book</div>
<p>The processional gospel (Matt. 21:1-11) sets the stage for the dramatic liturgy of the Sunday of the Passion. Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem heightens the expectations of those who were waiting for a Messiah to take the throne in Jerusalem. He upends their expectations with his humility and refusal to engage with Rome or the religious leaders on their terms. This entry parade is explored in great depth in the book <em>The Last Week: What the Gospels Really Teach about Jesus’ Final Days in Jerusalem</em>, by Marcus Borg and John Dominic Crossan (San Francisco: HarperOne, 2006). The authors show how Jesus’ parade was an alternative to the triumphal entry of Pontius Pilate that same week. How can our processions, liturgies, and lives reflect the humility and love of Jesus?</p>
<div class="resourceSubsection">Illustration</div>
<p>The passion reading is filled with details that are worth exploring. One is the description of the man who carried Jesus’ cross, Simon, as being from Cyrene, in northern Africa. Much Western art before the twentieth century depicts Simon as white. More recent images show him as a Black man. In the 1965 film <em>The Greatest Story Ever Told</em> (George Stevens Productions), Simon was played by Sidney Poitier. At Oakwood University, a historically Black college in Alabama, there is a <a href="https://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/35771" target="_new"><strong>large sculpture</strong></a> by Alan Collins depicting Simon as Black. How can the details of the story be used to help expand our imaginations and understanding of Jesus’ passion?</p>
<div class="resourceSubsection">Current Event</div>
<p>Jesus’ last words on the cross in Matthew are haunting and profound: “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (Matt. 27:46). Who are the people in your community who have felt forsaken by others or by God? Children in foster care? People who are incarcerated? Those living with depression? How can Jesus be presented in liturgy and preaching as one who is in solidarity with their forsakenness?</p>
<div class="resourceSubsection">Theological Reflection</div>
<p>In Philippians, Paul quotes a Christian hymn celebrating how Jesus’ emptying of himself in humility leads to being praised and exalted by God. Paul begins with this admonition: “Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus” (Phil. 2:5). Baptized people are called into a life like Jesus’ of emptying, humility, and complete trust in God. Worshipers could be encouraged to write down all the things they need to empty from themselves so they can be filled with the mind of Christ. These could be included in the offering and placed on the altar during the eucharist celebration, combining them with Jesus’ self-emptying love in the meal.</p>

<p>One way many of us may need to empty ourselves and be filled with the mind of Christ is by re-examining our use of social media. Many young people are having their minds strongly shaped by social media, often with harmful effects. The rise of anxiety and depression in young people has grown significantly since the rise of social media. Unrealistic expectations and judgments of others are filling teens’ minds. How can the church model for young people that being filled with the mind of Christ is life-giving? How can we show that self-giving love for others is the path to true life, and ease the burden of having to live up to unhelpful online expectations of others? <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/tween-and-teen-health/in-depth/teens-and-social-media-use/art-20474437" target="_new"><strong>Read more</strong></a> about the impact of social media on teenagers’ mental health.</p>

<p>In some congregations there is a tradition of reading the passion narrative with the assembly speaking the voice of the crowd. In his blog post <a href="http://www.ocotillopub.org/2019/04/passion-readings-on-not-being-crowd.html" target="_new"><strong>“On Not Being the Crowd,”</strong></a> Michael Coffey challenges this practice. He shows how the passion narrative invites us to identify with the disciples in their fear, running away, denial, and even betrayal, but says the gospel writers never intend for us to identify with the crowd calling for Jesus’ crucifixion. He writes: “The issue to ponder is why we are so fearful that we will not follow Jesus in the way of the cross.”</p>

<p>Lent and Holy Week 2023 coincide with the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset every day. This practice of spiritual emptying becomes an opportunity to fill oneself with awareness of God and needs of the neighbor. How can Christians, who hear about Christ’s emptying of himself on the cross in Philippians, learn from this Muslim tradition? In an <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/religion/the-emptiness-of-ramadan-makes-space-for-the-holy/10099758" target="_new"><strong>online article</strong></a> Susan Carland writes: “By emptying ourselves out—physically of food and spiritually of our attachment to anything that takes us away from God—we create the necessary space for the holy. Just as you cannot add to a full vessel, a soul full of itself has no room for God. A gap must be created.”</p>

<p>In his 1938 painting <a href="https://www.artic.edu/artworks/59426/white-crucifixion" target="_new"><strong><em>White Crucifixion</em>,</strong></a> Jewish artist Marc Chagall paints a moving image of Jesus on the cross and surrounds it with images of Jewish persecution. Chagall identifies the abandonment of Jesus with the suffering of Jews throughout history. How does the abandonment of Jesus on the cross connect Christians to all who suffer injustice and persecution?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.conspirare.org/considering-matthew-shepard/" target="_new"><strong><em>Considering Matthew Shepherd</em></strong></a> is a concert-length choral work composed by Craig Hella Johnson, artistic director of Conspirare, a Grammy-award winning group. The piece tells the story of Matthew Shepherd, the 21-year-old college student and gay man who was attacked and left for dead on October 7, 1998. He was tied to a fence in a field outside of Laramie, Wyoming. He died five days later in a hospital. Johnson wrote the piece in the form of a passion narrative, with the fence becoming a symbol of the cross.</p>

<p>Contemporary artist Kelly Latimore has created many beautiful and provocative images of saints and the life of Christ. Latimore’s <a href="https://kellylatimoreicons.com/collections/downloadables/products/the-crucifixion" target="_new"><strong><em>The Crucifixion</em></strong></a> captures the anguish of those gathered at the foot of the cross in a way that invites us to ponder how Jesus’ crucifixion affects us.</p></div>
    <h3>Let the Children Come</h3>
    <div><p>For kids who are starting to learn what it means to work for justice and peace in the world, today’s march on the road is a good example of faithfully speaking truth to power. Caesar may enter on a steed, but Jesus cracks a joke by entering Jerusalem on a donkey. A good song for marching, waving palms, and dancing through the aisles is “Pave the Way with Branches” (ACS 928). Before this Sunday, invite children to think of words for a few additional verses.</p></div>
    <h3>Connections with Creation</h3>
    <div><p>Jesus enters Jerusalem without a weapon, and yet, the gospel tells us, “the whole city was in turmoil” (Matt. 21:10)—the same Greek word that describes an earthquake. The world’s powers and principalities are deeply shaken when the king of peace rides into town and into our hearts. Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem resonates with nonviolent movements of resistance worldwide as people organize, educate, and advocate to defend land, air, and water and to avert ecological collapse. Are we willing to ride with Jesus into the boardrooms where decisions about energy and equity are made? Can we stand alongside frontline communities that are protesting the destruction and desecration of their lands and water? More than one hundred environmental activists are murdered worldwide every year. Shall we pray for some of them by name today?</p></div>
    <h3>Lectionary Notes by Gail Ramshaw</h3>
    <div><p class="commentaryDayName">Sunday of the Passion / Palm Sunday, Year A</p>
<p class="commentaryAuthor">Gail Ramshaw</p>
<p class="sectionHead">E-formation</p>
<p>To grasp something fully, we need to look at both sides. This coming Sunday is both Palm Sunday and the Sunday of the Passion. We join in the joy of the palm procession, and we gather in sorrow at the foot of the cross. Come to sing both “Hosanna!” and “Lord, have mercy upon us.”</p>
<p class="sectionHead">The Readings in the Bible</p>
<p>
  <div><a href="#" class="scripture" data-bibleversion="NRSV" data-citation="Matthew 21:1-11" data-readingCode="A-palm-su-g-proc">Matthew 21:1-11</a></div>
  <div>Matthew’s gospel, which was probably written in the mid-80s <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">ce</span>, is an editing of Mark’s earlier work, with material added probably both from a lost document called Q and from sources available only to Matthew. In Matthew the Jewish idea of righteousness figures as part of the proclamation of faith in Jesus as the Messiah, and aspects of Matthew reflect the debate after the destruction of the temple in 70 <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">ce</span> between rabbinic Judaism and the Christian movement. The last week of Jesus’ life began with his triumphal entry into Jerusalem, a sign of his kingship that Christians believe was foretold by the prophets. Only Matthew’s account of the entry into Jerusalem cites Zechariah as validation for this event.</div>
</p>
<p>
  <div><a href="#" class="scripture" data-bibleversion="NRSV" data-citation="Matthew 26:14—27:66" data-readingCode="A-palm-su-g">Matthew 26:14—27:66</a></div>
  <div>Matthew’s passion narrative closely follows Mark’s, while displaying judicious editing. Four narrative units have been added: the conversation with Judas, and his suicide; two passages about Pilate’s involvement in the verdict; some apocalyptic signs and resurrections that accompany the death of Jesus; and the placing of the Roman guard at the tomb. Raymond Brown’s comparative study of the passion narratives suggests that much of this material arose in popular tradition and reflects growing interest in both positive and negative details to fill out the narrative about Jesus’ execution.</div>
</p>
<p>
  <div><a href="#" class="scripture" data-bibleversion="NRSV" data-citation="Isaiah 50:4-9a" data-readingCode="A-palm-su-f">Isaiah 50:4-9a</a></div>
  <div>Second Isaiah, probably arising during the exile about 550 <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">bce</span>, includes four “Servant Songs,” in which Israel itself, described as God’s servant, is chosen and anointed with God’s Spirit to bring justice to the people. Isaiah 50, the third Servant Song, is spoken in the first person and emphasizes the humiliation endured by the servant, described as a teacher, whose trust is in God.</div>
</p>
<p>
  <div><a href="#" class="scripture" data-bibleversion="NRSV" data-citation="Philippians 2:5-11" data-readingCode="A-palm-su-s">Philippians 2:5-11</a></div>
  <div>Philippians is a letter sent by Paul and his associates to the church in Philippi, an important Roman city, in the mid or late 50s. The letter stresses the joy of the gospel, despite trying circumstances. Paul quotes an early Christian hymn, perhaps his own composition, that affirms faith in Christ Jesus as the incarnation of God. Christ, having emptied himself, was ultimately exalted by God as Lord.</div>
</p>
<p class="sectionHead">The Readings on This Day</p>
<p>
  <div><strong>Sunday of the Passion / Palm Sunday</strong></div>
  <div>Since at least the fourth century and universally in the church since the eighth, Christians have kept the Sunday before Easter as a memorial of Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem, and a literal procession of palms, started in Jerusalem, has spread throughout the world. During Year A, most of the Sunday gospels are taken from Matthew, and so this year on this Sunday a reading of Matthew 21 with a palm procession marks the opening of worship. As well, the three-year lectionary restored an ancient practice of observing the Sunday before Easter as Passion Sunday, and so a longer or shorter reading from the passion in Matthew functions as the gospel of the day. Since in the three-year lectionary Lent has replaced a sustained meditation on the passion with a focus on baptism, the proclamation of the full passion on this Sunday is key. Thus the service, inaugurating the most important week of the Christian year, has a two-part focus: Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem, and his passion and death. Assemblies can be helped to encounter the quite different theological emphases between Passion Sunday’s proclamation from the synoptic gospel of the year and Good Friday’s annual proclamation from John.</div>
</p>
<p>
  <div><a href="#" class="scripture" data-bibleversion="NRSV" data-citation="Matthew 21:1-11" data-readingCode="A-palm-su-g-proc">Matthew 21:1-11</a></div>
  <div>Holy Week begins with a palm procession and the proclamation of Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem from the gospel of Matthew. Christ enters the assembly now, just as he did then, and we praise his presence among us. “Hosanna” is now our song.</div>
</p>
<p>
  <div><a href="#" class="scripture" data-bibleversion="NRSV" data-citation="Matthew 26:14—27:66" data-readingCode="A-palm-su-g">Matthew 26:14—27:66</a></div>
  <div>Twice each Holy Week we hear the entire story of the betrayal, arrest, trials, abuse, and crucifixion of Jesus. Since it is Sunday, we listen to Matthew, the synoptic gospel of this year.</div>
</p>
<p>
  <div><a href="#" class="scripture" data-bibleversion="NRSV" data-citation="Isaiah 50:4-9a" data-readingCode="A-palm-su-f">Isaiah 50:4-9a</a></div>
  <div>Christians have seen in the Servant Songs descriptions of Jesus Christ. The reading imagines Jesus himself as describing his ill treatment, while affirming his innocence and his trust in God.</div>
</p>
<p>
  <div><a href="#" class="scripture" data-bibleversion="NRSV" data-citation="Philippians 2:5-11" data-readingCode="A-palm-su-s">Philippians 2:5-11</a></div>
  <div>We join with Christians of the first century in a creedal poem: Christ humbled himself to death, and God has raised him as Lord. The ancient song is a summary, not only of our baptismal faith, but also of the Holy Week which has begun.</div>
</p>
<p class="sectionHead">Images in the Readings</p>
<p>Two opposite images of Christ come in the readings. First, Christ is <strong>king</strong>. In Matthew’s passion narrative, he is acclaimed as the Son of David; he is the apocalyptic Son of Man, who will judge the world at the end of time; he is accused of falsely presenting himself as Messiah, yet affirmed by believers as the Christ; he is mocked as the “king of the Jews”; and ironically, even when dead, his body is attended by Roman guards. Much in American culture resists “king” as a positive image. Yet the hope that someone has ultimate power, absolute justice, and endless mercy persists in human imagination.</p>
<p>In an image that derives from the first and second readings. Christ is <strong>servant</strong>. God will vindicate the servant, even though he is now suffering. We are to adopt the mind of Christ Jesus, who became a servant, indeed a slave, for us. Once again, much in American culture resists “servant” as a positive image. Martin Luther’s essay “The Freedom of the Christian” can help us here: through our baptism, we are both free, slaves to none, and simultaneously servants to all.</p>
<p class="sectionHead">Connections with the Liturgy</p>
<p>Each Sunday at the eucharistic table, we sing the hosanna: just as Jesus processed before the people on the first Palm Sunday, so we acclaim Jesus before us in bread and wine. Hosanna: save us, Lord. As well, each Sunday’s thanksgiving at the eucharistic table, like the song in Philippians, retells the Christian gospel. Jesus Christ is God for us, his death a living reality that gives us salvation.</p>
<p class="sectionHead">The Prayer of the Day</p>
<p>There are three options for the prayer of the day. The first option, inspired by prayer #329 in the seventh-century Gelasian Sacramentary, summarizes the faith of the church about the meaning of the passion and death of Christ and prays for participation in his obedience. The second option, based upon a prayer in the 2002 collection <em>Revised Common Lectionary Prayers</em>, p. 91, echoes both our palm procession and the Philippians hymn in a petition for obedient servanthood. The third option comes from the 1978 <em>Lutheran Book of Worship</em> and connects the passion and death of Christ with the life of the resurrection.</p>
<p class="sectionHead">The Psalm for the Day</p>
<p><a href="#" class="scripture" data-bibleversion="NRSV" data-citation="Psalm 118:1-2, 19-29" data-readingCode="A-palm-su-p-proc">Psalm 118:1-2, 19-29</a>: The palm procession may include the singing of Psalm 118, which is a communal praise to God for victory. Verses 19-29 were perhaps sung as part of a festive temple procession at the Feast of Tabernacles. The phrase “the stone that the builders rejected” has been seen by Christians as a reference to Christ. Although this Sunday is the start of Holy Week, Sunday is always the day of Christ’s resurrection: thus, “this is the day that the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> has made,” and together we rejoice.</p>
<p><a href="#" class="scripture" data-bibleversion="NRSV" data-citation="Psalm 31:9-16" data-readingCode="A-palm-su-p">Psalm 31:9-16</a>: Following a Christian reading of the third Servant Song, Psalm 31 functions to reiterate the suffering of the servant, to recall the passion of Christ, and to stand with Jesus in his trust of God. The words of the psalm also give assemblies language with which to hold before God all innocent victims who are suffering.</p>
<p class="sectionHead">A Hymn for the Day</p>
<p><em>Evangelical Lutheran Worship</em> appoints as a proper hymn for the palm procession “All glory, laud, and honor” (ELW, p. 257, #344). According to tradition, this hymn was composed in 821 by Theodulph, bishop of Orleans. Imprisoned for suspected political machinations, he observed the palm procession as it proceeded past his cell, and he wrote this hymn as his participation in the Holy Week ritual. We are called into the contrast between the joyous voice of children and the reality of Theodulph’s situation.</p>
<p>Another hymn appropriate for this Sunday is “Jesus, I will ponder now” (ELW 345). The opening line of the hymn states that this is the day to meditate on Christ’s passion, and given the focus in the stanzas on Jesus’ unrelieved sufferings, Passion Sunday, rather than Good Friday, is the most appropriate occasion to sing this hymn. It was written in the seventeenth century by the poet Sigismund von Birken, the son of a Lutheran pastor. For his hymn tunes, Melchior Vulpius adapted Italian dance music, and even this tune need not be sung like a dirge. It can be both stately and buoyant.</p>
<p class="sectionHead">Life on the Earth</p>
<p>Matthew’s gospel includes the detail of an earthquake at both Jesus’ death (27:51) and his resurrection (28:2), as if the earth itself participates in the upheavals that Christ brings. It was usual in the apocalyptic tradition to anticipate earthquakes as heralding the end of this world, and here Matthew wrote that Jesus’ crucifixion marked the end of the world as it was. Even though we now understand how and why earthquakes function, they still are psychological symbols of unexpected terror, a rending of all things, the very earth no longer stable. Neither, we now know, are the glaciers or the weather patterns stable. We long for the earth to be secure, but it is not. We join with Jesus in prayer to God (27:46): has God forsaken us?</p>
<p class="sectionHead">Especially for Children</p>
<p>If there is a crucifix in or near the sanctuary, lead the children toward it and explain it. Tell them what INRI means. Talk to them about how Jesus is a king. If there is no crucifix in the worship space, bring one in for this Sunday—a pectoral cross, a wall crucifix, or a projected image.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Assisi-frescoes-entry-into-jerusalem-pietro_lorenzetti.jpg" target="_new"><strong>fourteenth-century fresco by Pietro Lorenzetti,</strong></a> painted on the walls of the Basilica in Assisi, Italy, depicts the scene of the palm procession as Jesus entered Jerusalem. The donkey bows its head, thus conveying its meekness, in contrast to how a royal battle horse would be depicted. Gustave Doré’s 1866 <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gustave_Dor%C3%A9_-_Crucifixion_of_Jesus.jpg" target="_new"><strong>wood engraving</strong></a> is appropriate for Matthew’s passion narrative, because it does not give prominence to Mary and John, as do many passion scenes.</p>
<p class="sectionHead">Comments from the Cloud of Witnesses</p>
<p>
  <div>Many indeed are the wondrous happenings of that time: God hanging from a cross, the sun made dark, and again flaming out—for it was fitting that creation should mourn with its Creator. The temple veil rent; the earth shaken, the rocks shattered because of the Rock; the dead risen to bear witness to the final and universal resurrection of the dead; the happenings at the sepulcher, and after the selculcher: who can fittingly recount them? Yet no one of them can be compared to the miracle of my salvation. A few drops of blood renew the whole world, and they do for all what the rennet does for the milk: joining us and binding us together.</div>
