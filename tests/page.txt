            <h2> Sunday, March 12, 2023<br />Third Sunday in Lent, Year A</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <div>In today’s gospel the Samaritan woman asks Jesus for water, an image of our thirst for God. Jesus offers living water, a sign of God’s grace flowing from the waters of baptism. The early church used this gospel and those of the next two Sundays to deepen baptismal reflection during the final days of preparation before baptism at Easter. As we journey to the resurrection feast, Christ comes among us in word, bath, and meal&#8212;offering us the life-giving water of God’s mercy and forgiveness.</div>
    <h3>Confession and Forgiveness</h3>
    <div><p>
  <div class="rubric">
    <div>All may make the sign of the cross, the sign that is marked at baptism, as the presiding minister begins.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="body">
    <div>Blessed be the holy Trinity, <span class="redtext">☩</span> one God,</div>
    <div>who journeys with us these forty days,</div>

    <div><strong>Amen.</strong></div>

  <p>Silence is kept for reflection.</p>
</div>
<div class="body">
  <p>
    <div>Holy God,</div>
    <div><strong>we confess to you our faults and failings.</strong></div>
    <div><strong>Too often we neglect and do not trust your holy word;</strong></div>
    <div><strong>we take for ourselves instead of giving to others;</strong></div>
    <div><strong>we spoil rather than steward your creation;</strong></div>
    <div><strong>we cause hurt though you call us to heal;</strong></div>
    <div><strong>we choose fear over compassion.</strong></div>
    <div><strong>Forgive us, renew us, and lead us,</strong></div>
    <div><strong>as we seek to follow in your way of life.</strong></div>
    <div><strong>Amen.</strong></div>
  </p>
  <p>
    <div>Hear the good news:</div>
    <div>God so loved the world that God gave the only Son,</div>
    <div>so that all may receive life.</div>
    <div>This promise is for you!</div>
    <div>God embraces you with divine mercy,</div>
    <div><span class="redtext">☩</span> forgives you in Christ’s name,</div>
    <div>and revives you in the Spirit’s power.</div>
    <div><strong>Amen.</strong></div>

    <h3>Prayer of the Day</h3>

    <h3>First Reading: Exodus 17:1-7</h3>
         <div class="reading_intro"><div class="body"><em>Because the thirsty Israelites quarreled with Moses and put God to the test, Moses cried out in desperation to God. God commanded Moses to strike the rock to provide water for the people. The doubt-filled question—“Is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> among us or not?”—received a very positive answer.</em></div></div>
    <div><div class="body"><span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>1</sup></span>From the wilderness of Sin the whole congregation of the Israelites journeyed by stages, as the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>2</sup></span>The people quarreled with Moses, and said, “Give us water to drink.” Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span>?” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>3</sup></span>But the people thirsted there for water; and the people complained against Moses and said, “Why did you bring us out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and livestock with thirst?” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>4</sup></span>So Moses cried out to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span>, “What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>5</sup></span>The <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Go on ahead of the people, and take some of the elders of Israel with you; take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>6</sup></span>I will be standing there in front of you on the rock at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it, so that the people may drink.” Moses did so, in the sight of the elders of Israel. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>7</sup></span>He called the place Massah and Meribah, because the Israelites quarreled and tested the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span>, saying, “Is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> among us or not?”</div></div>

    <h3>Second Reading: Romans 5:1-11</h3>
         <div class="reading_intro"><div class="body"><em>Though we often hear that God helps those who help themselves, here Paul tells us that through Jesus’ death God helps utterly helpless sinners. Since we who had been enemies are reconciled to God in the cross, we now live in hope for our final salvation.</em></div></div>
    <div><div class="body"><span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>1</sup></span>Since we are justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>2</sup></span>through whom we have obtained access to this grace in which we stand; and we boast in our hope of sharing the glory of God. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>3</sup></span>And not only that, but we also boast in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>4</sup></span>and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>5</sup></span>and hope does not disappoint us, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit that has been given to us.<br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>6</sup></span>For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>7</sup></span>Indeed, rarely will anyone die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good person someone might actually dare to die. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>8</sup></span>But God proves his love for us in that while we still were sinners Christ died for us. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>9</sup></span>Much more surely then, now that we have been justified by his blood, will we be saved through him from the wrath of God. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>10</sup></span>For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more surely, having been reconciled, will we be saved by his life. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>11</sup></span>But more than that, we even boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.</div></div>
    <h3>Gospel: John 4:5-42</h3>
         <div class="reading_intro"><div class="body"><em>Jesus defies convention to engage a Samaritan woman in conversation. Her testimony, in turn, leads many others to faith.</em></div></div>
    <div><div class="body"><span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>5</sup></span><span style="color:lightgray">[</span>Jesus<span style="color:lightgray">]</span> came to a Samaritan city called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.<span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>6</sup></span>Jacob’s well was there, and Jesus, tired out by his journey, was sitting by the well. It was about noon.<br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>7</sup></span>A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her, “Give me a drink.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>8</sup></span>(His disciples had gone to the city to buy food.) <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>9</sup></span>The Samaritan woman said to him, “How is it that you, a Jew, ask a drink of me, a woman of Samaria?” (Jews do not share things in common with Samaritans.) <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>10</sup></span>Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>11</sup></span>The woman said to him, “Sir, you have no bucket, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water? <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>12</sup></span>Are you greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us the well, and with his sons and his flocks drank from it?” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>13</sup></span>Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>14</sup></span>but those who drink of the water that I will give them will never be thirsty. The water that I will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>15</sup></span>The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I may never be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water.”<br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>16</sup></span>Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come back.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>17</sup></span>The woman answered him, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband’; <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>18</sup></span>for you have had five husbands, and the one you have now is not your husband. What you have said is true!” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>19</sup></span>The woman said to him, “Sir, I see that you are a prophet. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>20</sup></span>Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you say that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>21</sup></span>Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>22</sup></span>You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>23</sup></span>But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such as these to worship him. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>24</sup></span>God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>25</sup></span>The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming” (who is called Christ). “When he comes, he will proclaim all things to us.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>26</sup></span>Jesus said to her, “I am he, the one who is speaking to you.”<br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>27</sup></span>Just then his disciples came. They were astonished that he was speaking with a woman, but no one said, “What do you want?” or, “Why are you speaking with her?” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>28</sup></span>Then the woman left her water jar and went back to the city. She said to the people, <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>29</sup></span>“Come and see a man who told me everything I have ever done! He cannot be the Messiah, can he?” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>30</sup></span>They left the city and were on their way to him.<br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>31</sup></span>Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, “Rabbi, eat something.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>32</sup></span>But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>33</sup></span>So the disciples said to one another, “Surely no one has brought him something to eat?” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>34</sup></span>Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>35</sup></span>Do you not say, ‘Four months more, then comes the harvest’? But I tell you, look around you, and see how the fields are ripe for harvesting. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>36</sup></span>The reaper is already receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>37</sup></span>For here the saying holds true, ‘One sows and another reaps.’ <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>38</sup></span>I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.”<br> <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>39</sup></span>Many Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me everything I have ever done.” <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>40</sup></span>So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them; and he stayed there two days. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>41</sup></span>And many more believed because of his word. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><sup>42</sup></span>They said to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is truly the Savior of the world.”</div></div>

            <h2> Sunday, March 12, 2023<br />Third Sunday in Lent</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <div><div class="resourceSubsection">Our “Other” at the Well</div>
<p>The woman at the well is a familiar text for many people. This image of Jesus standing at a well talking with a Samaritan woman is emblazoned in our visual and theological imaginations, but as with all Bible stories that we <em>think</em> we know, we might do well to take another look! Perhaps relegating this text to the simple moralism “be nice to people who are different” causes us to miss how deeply radical and difficult the message really is. We may assume this gospel simply urges us to stand with the marginalized, especially women. Yet while standing with marginalized women is a commendable action it can lead us, after doing so, to congratulate ourselves for being just like Jesus. A more critical and searching look at this text calls us to the reality that Jesus doesn’t just stand with <em>the other</em>, Jesus stands with <em>your</em> other; <em>your church’s</em> other. Your church’s “Samaritans” may be homosexuals, evangelicals, urban people, rural people, conservatives, liberals, the poor, the rich, the dying, or single parents. Your church’s Samaritans could very well be the key to this text. Because, like it or not, when we draw lines between ourselves and other people, Jesus is always on the <em>other</em> side of that line. So communities and individuals who thirst for the living water would do well to look to who our own Samaritans might be. And when we find them we should perhaps not be surprised to also find Jesus; a Jesus we thought was all our own but who, in reality, is the living water who comes to us in the strange and the stranger.</p></div>
    <h3>Ideas</h3>
    <div><div class="resourceSubsection">Denominational Resource</div>
<p>Pray and meditate on all the ways Christ breaks through our human-made barriers in order to share the promises of God. How does your congregation set up its worship space to reflect the in-breaking of God’s means of grace, namely the sacraments? For millennia, churches have placed the font of living water in the gathering space or at the entrance to the worship space. As the processional cross—along with the assembly’s own movement throughout the liturgy—enters by the font and approaches the table, we see the Christian life unfold: from bath to meal. Perhaps the altar guild could sponsor a discussion on the ELCA’s 1997 document <em>The Use of the Means of Grace: A Statement on the Practice of Word and Sacrament</em>. Pay particular attention to Principle 33, which lays out the belief in the real presence of Jesus Christ in holy communion.</p>
<div class="resourceSubsection">Current Event</div>
<div class="resourceSubsection">Gathering Space</div>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic isolated many people throughout the world. Reflect on those in your parish and surrounding community who were, or perhaps still are, most affected by the loneliness of the pandemic. As Jesus does with the unnamed Samaritan woman, how might the church meet people where they are, regardless of social mores? For example, it is common to host soup suppers throughout Lent. The Lenten meal, originally designed to provide fellowship and nourishment, often transforms into an insular supper club, seemingly meant for the church regulars. How can congregations reach out to those in desperate need of nourishment—in more ways than one?</p>
<div class="resourceSubsection">Theological Reflection</div>
<p>Why do we refer to the third Sunday <em>in</em> Lent instead of the third Sunday <em>of</em> Lent? The main reason is because Sundays are the Lord’s day, always a celebration of the resurrection, even in the midst of Lent. The body of Christ, the congregation, gathers to praise the <em>living</em> God’s remarkable victory over death, sin, and all evil. The “forty days” of Lent do not include Sundays.</p>
<div class="resourceSubsection">Current Event</div>
<div class="resourceSubsection">Video, Podcast</div>
<p>The late hymnwriter Susan Palo Cherwien (1953–2021) authored many hymns, including eight in <em>Evangelical Lutheran Worship</em>. She encouraged congregations to see music as a vital ministry of the church. Her hymn “O blessed spring” (ELW 447) is a hymn suggestion for today. David Cherwien, Susan’s husband and a renowned organist and choral director, created a YouTube series called “Hymns We Love to Sing.” Check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzcHXhF2T4w" target="_new"><strong>amazing story behind this hymn</strong></a> and prayerfully discern why it is suggested for this Sunday.</p>
<div class="resourceSubsection">Theological Reflection</div>
<p>The woman at the well is the exact opposite of Nicodemus in almost every way: sex, status, wealth, public regard, work. Combine last week’s gospel (John 3:1-17) with this week’s gospel. How does John set this up as one continuous story? There is a significant portion the lectionary omits between these two gospel readings. John 3:22-36 presents the final appearance of John the Baptist and his summation of who Jesus is. Likewise, the first four verses of John 4 are immensely helpful and could be included. They provide context, in location but also a brief background about the tensions between the Jews and Samaritans.</p>
<div class="resourceSubsection">Worship Space</div>
<div class="resourceSubsection">Testimony</div>
<p>Jesus says, “the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth” (John 4:23). Who are “the true worshipers”? Jesus bridges the divide not only between Jews and Samaritans, but by talking with the woman he is also making it clear that God is for “the whole world.” True worshipers will worship God in spirit and truth, meaning they will not seek God on either the mountain or in the temple. Rather, the Savior is present in the flesh, in the here and now! He is the living water that sustains and nourishes believers as they continue to embody the spirit and the truth.</p>
<div class="resourceSubsection">Visual Image / Artwork</div>
<p>One could assume, based on its title, that <a href="https://lucascranach.org/en/DE_MdbKL_41/" target="_new"><strong><em>Christ and the Good Samaritan</em>,</strong></a> a painting by Lucas Cranach the Elder (c. 1525–1537), depicts the Samaritan man who helps the battered traveler left to die in Luke 15. It doesn’t. What if instead of referring to the woman in John 4 as the “woman at the well,” we call her instead the good Samaritan? How does that change our perception of her? Notice in the painting the disciples waiting nervously in the background. Though they don’t say anything to Jesus, they are wondering why their leader is talking to a Samaritan, a woman no less!</p>
<div class="resourceSubsection">Book</div>
<div class="resourceSubsection">Current Event</div>
<p>In her paradigm-shifting book <em>Theology and the End of Doctrine</em>, Christine Helmer asks what reality is when it comes to Christian theology. She is curious to know “how that reality is communicated in a transhistorical way so that doctrine may be an opportunity both for a distinct experience of the living triune God and for inscribing a personal sense of the gospel into the living tradition of Christianity” (Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox Press, 2014, p. xi). In other words, to believe in Jesus Christ is not just knowing <em>about</em> him, rattling off lifeless descriptors of who he is. Rather, to believe in Jesus is to <em>be</em> with Jesus.</p>
<div class="resourceSubsection">Theological Reflection</div>
<div class="resourceSubsection">Denominational Resource</div>
<p>One of the sample intercessory prayers offered via Sundays and Seasons for this Sunday asks God to “Topple the dividing walls that separate us from our neighbors.” Who are our neighbors? What walls separate us? In the United States, one obvious example is the southern border wall. Is that the only wall that stands between Americans and others? What invisible walls do we put up around ourselves as we attempt to feel safe from others?</p></div>
    <h3>Let the Children Come</h3>
    <div><p>Children and youth are often curious about prayer practices from other faith traditions but may be unfamiliar with many from our own. Psalm 95 provides much of the text for the morning psalm in matins. This setting of worship is not intended for Sunday morning worship, but Psalm 95 appearing in our lectionary offers an opportunity to explore ancient Christian prayer practices. Introduce the terms for prayers at many times of the day: matins, vespers, and compline. Invite a child or youth to serve as cantor for Psalm 95 today using the setting from Morning Prayer in <em>Evangelical Lutheran Worship</em>, page 299.</p></div>
    <h3>Connections with Creation</h3>
    <div><p>Everyone needs water—what Nature Conservancy calls “that strange drinkable liquid that is not coffee or alcohol.” Water is essential, yet because clean water is so rare, roughly one in three people worldwide have no access to it. Today’s readings lift up the preciousness of both literal and spiritual water, the unending flow of divine love symbolized in the image of Moses releasing water from a rock (Exod. 17:1-7) and of Jesus providing “a spring of water gushing up to eternal life” (John 4:14). God’s love can pour down like gentle rain, softening hardened hearts and refreshing desert places. Or God’s love can spring up from within like a fountain because “God’s love has been poured into our hearts” (Rom. 5:5). How does the upwelling love of God move you to bring water to those who thirst and to stand up for communities where water is threatened by pipelines or polluting industries?</p></div>
    <h3>Lectionary Notes by Gail Ramshaw</h3>
    <div><p class="commentaryDayName">Third Sunday in Lent, Year A</p>
<p class="commentaryAuthor">Gail Ramshaw</p>
<p class="sectionHead">E-formation</p>
<p>During Lent we accompany Jesus to his cross and resurrection, and this coming Sunday we stop at a well to receive a drink of water. The water turns out to be Christ himself. Come to worship, and join all of us thirsty people, made alive in Christ.</p>
<p class="sectionHead">The Readings in the Bible</p>
<p>
  <div><a href="#" class="scripture" data-bibleversion="NRSV" data-citation="John 4:5-42" data-readingCode="A-lent3-su-g">John 4:5-42</a></div>
  <div>The gospel of John presents an interaction between Jesus and the Samaritan woman and so situates testimony to Christ outside of orthodox Judaism, although at the site of the historically important well of Jacob. Jesus is himself both thirsty and the source of living water, thus both human and divine. Jesus promised to give living water to all who ask and, at the conclusion of the dialogue, claimed for himself the divine name <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">I am</span>. The exchange resulted in these outsiders accepting Jesus as the Savior of the world.</div>
</p>
<p>
  <div><a href="#" class="scripture" data-bibleversion="NRSV" data-citation="Exodus 17:1-7" data-readingCode="A-lent3-su-f">Exodus 17:1-7</a></div>
  <div>According to Israelite memory, before the tribes settled in Canaan, they lived as nomads. From the tenth-century Yahwist tradition comes the narrative of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> providing water from the rock for the thirsty nomads. The site is Meribah, which means quarrel. The <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span> filled the need of the quarreling people by miraculously providing water.</div>
</p>
<p>
  <div><a href="#" class="scripture" data-bibleversion="NRSV" data-citation="Romans 5:1-11" data-readingCode="A-lent3-su-s">Romans 5:1-11</a></div>
  <div>The fifth chapter of Paul’s letter to the Romans intensifies the language describing the human need for justification. Humans were weak, ungodly, sinners, enemies of God. Only if the absolute need of humans for justification is accepted does the salvation provided by the death of Christ make any sense.</div>
</p>
<p class="sectionHead">The Readings on This Day</p>
<p>
  <div><strong>Third Sunday in Lent</strong></div>
  <div>During Lent, the church prepares its catechumens for baptism, and it renews its members in the meaning of baptism. In the early third-century house church excavated in Dura Europas, Syria, a wall painting of the woman at the well was set near to a tub-sized font in a room dedicated to baptizing. So on this Sunday we join with centuries of Christians to enjoy the narrative of the thirsty woman and so join with her to worship Christ, our living water.</div>
</p>
<p>
  <div><a href="#" class="scripture" data-bibleversion="NRSV" data-citation="John 4:5-42" data-readingCode="A-lent3-su-g">John 4:5-42</a></div>
  <div>Since at least the fourth century, the narrative of Jesus and the Samaritan woman has been used to explicate Christian baptism. Christ himself both provides and is the living water. In Lent we join with the Samaritan woman, seeking the living water of Christ and telling our neighbors of the one who quenched our thirst.</div>
</p>
<p>
  <div><a href="#" class="scripture" data-bibleversion="NRSV" data-citation="Exodus 17:1-7" data-readingCode="A-lent3-su-f">Exodus 17:1-7</a></div>
  <div>The narrative of Moses striking the rock is set as a parallel to the story of the Samaritan woman at the well. In both, God provides miraculous water. Like the Israelites, we too are journeying towards the water of life, quarreling along the way, yet requiring what only God can give. God is our water.</div>
</p>
<p>
  <div><a href="#" class="scripture" data-bibleversion="NRSV" data-citation="Romans 5:1-11" data-readingCode="A-lent3-su-s">Romans 5:1-11</a></div>
  <div>The lectionary continues its Lenten readings from Romans. The passage for this Sunday, with its strong language about sinners, is appropriate on the day that we consider the quarreling Israelites, the five-times-married Samaritan woman, and ourselves.</div>
</p>
<p class="sectionHead">Images in the Readings</p>
<p>The primary image for this Sunday is <strong>water</strong>. Water: that life as we know it on earth requires water is perhaps the reason that water figures in countless stories in all cultures, stories of rivers and seas, wells and rain. The Bible is overflowing with water stories, some of which we will hear at the Easter Vigil. In our time, daily showers, public fountains, swimming pools, and water parks provide society with the refreshment of water. Yet we are told that the next world wars will be over water, and current Christian ecologists urge care for the waters of the earth. In medieval Christian art, a picture of Moses striking the rock so that water can flow was set next to a depiction of Christ on the cross being pierced with the sword, as the water of life flowed from his side.</p>
<p>Another image for the day is the <strong>rock</strong>. In the Psalms, God is called Rock 22 times. That water can flow from rock provides us with a double image for God.</p>
<p class="sectionHead">Connections with the Liturgy</p>
<p>In <em>Evangelical Lutheran Worship</em> Thanksgiving at the Font V are the words, “Praise to you for your saving waters . . . . The Israelites drink from your gushing rock, and the Samaritan woman will never be thirsty again.” When using this thanksgiving, names of specific local waters—rivers, lakes, the sea—can be inserted into the second paragraph: “Glory to you for oceans and lakes, for rivers and streams, for . . . .”</p>
<p class="sectionHead">The Prayer of the Day</p>
<p>The prayer of the day is adapted for <em>Evangelical Lutheran Worship</em> from a longer prayer attributed to Columbanus, a seventh-century Irish monk and missionary. Calling God our fountain of living water, it uses language from John 4 to pray for “the beauty of your truth” coming to us through Christ.</p>
<p class="sectionHead">The Psalm for the Day</p>
<p>Called an enthronement psalm, probably sung at an Israelite festival praising the king and God as the sovereign, <a href="#" class="scripture" data-bibleversion="NRSV" data-citation="Psalm 95" data-readingCode="A-lent3-su-p">Psalm 95</a> gives us words to join with the thirsty nomads who are drinking water from the rock. The psalm praises God as the rock, the great ruler, the creator, the shepherd. Having heeded the first reading, we respond with the promise that we will not harden our hearts, as they did at Meribah.</p>
<p class="sectionHead">A Hymn for the Day</p>
<p>A hymn appropriate for the day is “As the deer runs to the river” (ELW 331). This is one of the fine hymns that Lutheran pastor, seminary professor, and finally seminary president Herman Stuempfle wrote during his retirement. The hymns sets us next to the woman at the well, thirsting for living water, and the second stanza celebrates today’s first reading from Exodus 17. The reference in the fourth stanza to desert places is particularly appropriate for Lenten song.</p>
<p class="sectionHead">Life on the Earth</p>
<p>Although many Westerners tend to take clean water for granted, we are told that many local, tribal, and even international conflicts in the future will be over water rights: Who gets to use the available water? We are also told that global warming will melt glaciers and thus raise sea levels, and that in consequence, countless villages and cities situated on the coast lines of the earth will be flooded out. Life on the earth is always about water—too little, too much, too dirty, too expensive—for humans cannot live without water. This Sunday, the second petition of the intercessions that addresses the well-being of the earth can focus on the well-being of earth’s waters, its seas, lakes, rivers, streams and wells.</p>
<p class="sectionHead">Especially for Children</p>
<p>Gather the children around the font. We are all the woman at the well. The water of baptism is one way that Jesus gives us water. Have the children sign one another with the water. Have the older children walk up and down the aisles with a bowl of water from the font and an evergreen sprig, to sprinkle the assembly with living water.</p>

<p>An Eastern Orthodox icon of Jesus and the woman at the well, who in legend is named St. Photina, makes clear that the church has connected the well of John 4 to baptism: in <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:St_Photina.jpg" target="_new"><strong>this depiction,</strong></a> the well is in the shape of a cross, as were some ancient fonts. One such cross-shaped font was in the church in Ephesus.</p>
<p class="sectionHead">Comments from the Cloud of Witnesses</p>
<p>
  <div>John’s gospel says the Samaritan woman was invited to take all the water she needed. The early centuries of the church, and now we again, have seen in the Samaritan woman an image of us all. We all search in the wrong place for refreshment, lugging home water which gives out or goes bad; we continuously need more water; we are always somewhat thirsty, dirty or raw. We thought to find water there, down at the stream, and were surprised to find it here, directly before us. Turning around—the word is conversion—we find a water source we had not even imagined. Baptism, says the church, is this water source, this fountain of God, this conversation with Christ, this gift of self-knowledge, this sense of mission, this true religious rite, this conversion of life.</div>
