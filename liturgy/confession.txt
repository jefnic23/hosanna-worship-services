P: Blessed be the holy Trinity, one God, who journeys with us these forty days, and sustains us with the gift of grace.
C: Amen.
P: Let us acknowledge before God and one another our need for repentance and God’s mercy.
Holy God,
C: we confess to you our faults and failings.
Too often we neglect and do not trust your holy word;
we take for ourselves instead of giving to others;
we spoil rather than steward your creation;
we cause hurt though you call us to heal;
we choose fear over compassion.
Forgive us, renew us, and lead us,
as we seek to follow in your way of life.
Amen.
P: Hear the good news:
God so loved the world that God gave the only Son,
so that all may receive life.
This promise is for you!
God embraces you with divine mercy,
God forgives you in Christ’s name,
and revives you in the Spirit’s power.
C: Amen.
